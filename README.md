# Live dot NET

This project is a starting point.

## Project Structure

- `SeniorDotNetProject.Web`: MVC and Razor Pages application
- `SeniorDotNetProject.API`: Web API project
- `SeniorDotNetProject.Data`: Data access layer

## Coding Questions

How would you do the following:

1. Add a new API endpoint in the `WeatherForecastController` that returns the weather forecast for a specific date.
2. Implement a new `ProductsController` in the API project that performs CRUD operations on the `Product` entity.
3. Create a new Razor Page in the Web project that displays a list of products fetched from the API.
4. Implement client-side form validation using jQuery in the product creation/edit page.
5. Add authentication to the API using JWT tokens.
6. Implement a simple caching mechanism for the weather forecast data.
7. Write unit tests for the `WeatherForecastController`.
8. Implement a simple logging mechanism using a third-party logging framework like Serilog.
